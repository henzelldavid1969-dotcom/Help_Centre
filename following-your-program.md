# Following your Program

Phenomenal has been designed to be incredibly easy to follow.

The program is split into ten modules, each with a number of lessons (sometimes called sessions or trainings).

They all follow the same basic structure as follows:

- 
The **module name** and **number **is at the top.
​

- 
The **lesson name** is nice and big just under that.
​

- 
The **lesson image or video** takes pride of place. If the lesson has video content you'll see an orange "play" button - if there isn't one, it just means we didn't think this lesson benefited from a video. No biggie. 
​

- 
The "**lesson content**" is all presented below. This is the good stuff, what you came here for. All lessons are different and will guide you through your journey to sobriety.

## 
Lesson content might include:

- 
**Content** to read, digest and reflect upon.
​

- 
**Worksheets** to download and complete
​

- 
Additional **videos** to watch or **audio recordings** to listen to.
​

- 
**Questions** to answer
​

- 
**Reflections** to make and actions to take

## Accessing Downloads

If there is an associated PDF worksheet or download, this (or these) will be immediately below the lesson. Simples. Just click to download the one you want. They will always be there to come back to if you want to print them out again.

### Actions

Actions and activities are fundamentally what makes Phenomenal literally unique. I know everyone says that but it's true.

Every lesson as content you use to learn AND activities to use that knowledge and build your sobriety toolkit.

Each time you complete an activity you check it off! You're even awarded points for a bit of fun.

In the background the Phenomenal Sobriety Engine is monitoring your progress and will tailor your program accordingly.

### Here's a few examples of how XP and The Phenomenal Sobriety Engine might affect your experience:

- 
**Doing really well?** On a winning streak - you may be awarded extra or bonus content.
​

- 
**Hit a milestone achievement** - you may get a personalised message, a reward or a cheeky celebration.
​

- 
**Struggling a bit not logged in for a while**? You may get a message or email checking if you're okay and seeing if you'd like some extra help.

The possibilities are endless, meaning that even though everyone gets the complete course, their experience of it is personalised may differ. If you need some extra motivation you'll get it. If you deserve a pat on the back - you'll get that.

Stopping drinking doesn't need to be scary or a drag - with Phenomenal, it's not.
