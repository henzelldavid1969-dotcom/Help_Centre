# Is my drinking a problem?

Many people struggle with this question, often because our culture has normalised problematic drinking behaviours. The truth is, you don't need to hit a dramatic "rock bottom" to decide that alcohol isn't serving you anymore. Here are some key indicators to consider:

## Behavioural Signs:

* You find yourself thinking about drinking throughout the day
* You've tried to set drinking limits but struggle to stick to them
* You drink more or for longer than you initially planned
* You've cancelled plans or missed obligations due to drinking or hangovers
* You find yourself hiding or lying about your drinking
* You continue drinking despite negative consequences
* You've developed increased tolerance (needing more to achieve the same effect)

## Physical Signs:

* Regular hangovers that interfere with daily life
* Sleep disturbances or insomnia
* Unexplained health issues
* Memory gaps or blackouts
* Feeling shaky or anxious without alcohol

## Emotional Signs:

* Feeling guilty or ashamed about your drinking
* Using alcohol to cope with stress, anxiety, or other emotions
* Experiencing mood swings or irritability
* Feeling defensive when others comment on your drinking
* Wondering if you have a problem (this itself is often a sign)

## Social Impact:

* Relationships are strained due to your drinking
* You've had conflicts with family, friends, or colleagues related to alcohol
* You find yourself preferring to drink alone
* You've experienced professional consequences
* You feel uncomfortable in situations where alcohol isn't available

**Remember**: You don't need to identify with all or even most of these signs to have a problematic relationship with alcohol. If drinking is causing you concern or negatively impacting any area of your life, that's enough reason to explore change.
