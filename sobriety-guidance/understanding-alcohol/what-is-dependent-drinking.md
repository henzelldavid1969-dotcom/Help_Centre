# What is "dependent drinking"?

Dependent drinking goes beyond casual or social drinking. It's a pattern where alcohol becomes central to daily functioning, often developing gradually over time. Through my work supporting others, I've seen how this can impact lives in various ways:

## Key Signs to Be Aware Of:

- 
**Physical Changes**

- 
Needing more alcohol to feel the same effects

- 
Experiencing shakes, sweats, or anxiety without alcohol

- 
Morning drinking to feel "normal"

- 
**Emotional Patterns**

- 
Using alcohol to manage stress or anxiety

- 
Feeling unable to face situations without drinking

- 
Experiencing guilt or shame about drinking

- 
**Behavioural Shifts**

- 
Prioritising drinking over other activities

- 
Finding it hard to stop once you start

- 
Planning life around alcohol access

- 
**Daily Impact**

- 
Work or family responsibilities becoming affected

- 
Relationships showing strain

- 
Financial pressures from drinking

## Understanding Dependence:

- 
It's not about willpower or moral failure

- 
It develops through complex physical and psychological factors

- 
It can affect anyone, regardless of background

- 
Professional support is often needed for safe recovery

If you're concerned about dependent drinking, it's important to understand that this is a medical condition that requires proper support. The physical aspects of alcohol dependence can be serious, and attempting to stop suddenly can be dangerous.

The good news is that with the right support, many people successfully overcome dependent drinking and rebuild their lives. The key is reaching out for professional help to ensure a safe and supported journey to recovery.
