# UK & US Differences.

Let me help clarify the differences between UK and US alcohol measurements - it's an area that can cause confusion but is important to understand:

## UK Measures:

* One unit = 8g/10ml pure alcohol
* Pint = 568ml (20 fl oz)
* Single spirit = 25ml
* Wine glass = 175ml (standard serve)
* Units are the standard measure

## US Measures:

* One "standard drink" = 14g pure alcohol
* Pint = 473ml (16 fl oz)
* Single spirit = 44ml (1.5 fl oz)
* Wine glass = 148ml (5 fl oz)
* Standard drinks are the measure used

## Key Differences to Note:

* US standard drink is larger than UK unit
* UK pints are bigger than US pints
* Spirit measures are different
* Wine servings vary between countries

## Why This Matters:

* Affects how you track consumption
* Changes drinking guidelines
* Impacts pour sizes in bars/restaurants
* Influences how much you're actually drinking



Understanding these differences is particularly important if you travel between countries or read international health guidance. What might seem like the same amount could actually be quite different.
