# Beer, Wine or Spirits

The truth is, alcohol is alcohol, regardless of what form it takes. While there are some differences between beer, wine, and spirits, what matters most is how we consume them and their impact on our lives:

## Understanding Different Drinks:

* Beer: Usually 4-6% alcohol
* Wine: Typically 12-15% alcohol
* Spirits: Generally 40% or higher

## Common Misconceptions:

* "Beer is safer than spirits"
* "Wine is healthier than other alcohol"
* "Spirits are more dangerous"

## What Really Matters:

* The total amount of alcohol consumed
* Your pattern of drinking
* How alcohol affects you personally
* Your relationship with different drinks

## Important Considerations:

* Spirits can lead to quicker intoxication
* Beer and wine often involve longer drinking sessions
* Mixed drinks can hide alcohol content
* All types can lead to dependence



The idea that some forms of alcohol are "better" or "safer" than others can be misleading. While different drinks may affect us in different ways, it's our relationship with alcohol itself that matters most, not the form it takes.

Many people find they have particular triggers or patterns with certain types of alcohol. Understanding these patterns can be more important than choosing between different drinks.
