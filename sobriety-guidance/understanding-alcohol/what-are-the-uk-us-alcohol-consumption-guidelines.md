# Consumption Guidelines?

Let me help clarify the drinking guidelines from both the UK and US - they take slightly different approaches but share common goals for supporting wellbeing:

## UK Guidelines:

* No more than 14 units per week for both men and women
* Spread drinking over 3+ days if drinking regularly
* Have several alcohol-free days each week
* No "safe" drinking level during pregnancy

## US Guidelines:

* Women: Up to 1 standard drink per day
* Men: Up to 2 standard drinks per day
* No drinking recommended during pregnancy
* Adults under 21: No alcohol consumption

## Important Context:

* UK focuses on weekly limits
* US emphasises daily limits
* Neither country suggests drinking is "safe"
* Both recommend alcohol-free days

## Remember:

* These are guidelines, not targets
* Individual tolerance varies greatly
* Guidelines don't account for personal circumstances
* Lower consumption generally means lower risk



**Worth Noting:** Both countries continue to research and update their guidance as new evidence emerges about alcohol's health impacts. The trend has been toward recommending lower consumption levels over time.
