Deciding to stop drinking alcohol is a personal choice and can have various impacts on your social life, but it doesn't necessarily mean you'll lose your friends. Here are some points to consider:

### True Friendships:

Genuine friends will respect your decision and support you, regardless of whether you drink or not. You might find that some friendships grow stronger as they are based on mutual respect and shared interests beyond drinking. ​

### Social Activities:

You may need to find new ways to socialise that don't revolve around alcohol. Consider exploring activities like sports, hobbies, or cultural events where drinking isn't the main focus. ​

### New Connections:

You might meet new people who share your lifestyle choices, broadening your social circle. ​

### Communication:

Be open with your friends about your decision and the reasons behind it. This can help them understand and support you.



Ultimately, the impact on your social life will depend on your current social circle and how you choose to engage with them. It's important to prioritise your well-being and make choices that align with your values and goals.
