# The hair of the dog

"The hair of the dog" is a common but potentially problematic approach to handling hangovers. Let's see why:

## What is "Hair of the Dog"?

The phrase comes from an old folk remedy for rabies (using the dog's hair that bit you to cure the bite). In drinking terms, it means having another alcoholic drink to relieve hangover symptoms.

## Why People Try It:

* Temporarily relieves hangover symptoms
* Delays withdrawal effects
* Can feel like it's "working"
* Often part of drinking culture

## What's Actually Happening:

* Drinking more alcohol temporarily masks symptoms
* Delays inevitable hangover
* Can lead to continued drinking
* May signal developing dependence

## Why It's Problematic:

* Doesn't address the real cause of hangovers
* Can create unhealthy patterns
* May indicate relationship issues with alcohol
* Often leads to worse symptoms later



**Worth Considering:** If you find yourself regularly needing "hair of the dog" to function, it might be worth examining your relationship with alcohol. Many people find this pattern can be an early warning sign of developing alcohol dependence.
