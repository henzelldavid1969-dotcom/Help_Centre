# A Word about Naltrexone?

There a re a few very important things to consider if you have been prescribed Naltrexone. Naltrexone is primarily used in two main treatment approaches:

### Alcohol Use Disorder Treatment

* It helps reduce alcohol cravings by blocking the pleasurable effects of alcohol in the brain
* Patients often experience a decreased desire to continue drinking
* It can be prescribed as part of a comprehensive treatment program that includes counselling and support groups



### Opioid Addiction Recovery

* Naltrexone blocks the euphoric and sedative effects of opioids
* It can help prevent relapse in individuals recovering from opioid addiction
* It works by binding to opioid receptors, effectively blocking the effects of opioids

## Important Practical Considerations:

* The medication does not cause physical dependence
* It requires complete abstinence from opioids before starting (typically 7-10 days)
* Available in oral tablet form (daily) or long-acting injectable form (monthly)
* Most effective when combined with counselling and support programs

## Potential Side Effects:

* Nausea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Mild anxiety
* Sleep disturbances

## Critical Medical Precautions:

* Must inform your doctor about all current medications
* Cannot be used if you are currently using opioids
* Requires liver function monitoring
* Not recommended for patients with acute hepatitis or liver failure



A healthcare provider will carefully assess your individual situation to determine if Naltrexone is appropriate for your treatment plan.

They will discuss potential benefits, risks, and monitor your progress throughout the treatment.

Remember, lifestyle change, coaching and recovery work are all important, regardless of any medication you may be on. Feel free to get in touch to see how and when Phenomenal may be right for you.
