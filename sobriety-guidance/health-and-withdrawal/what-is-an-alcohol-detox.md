# What is an alcohol detox?

You may have heard of people getting a "detox" for their alcohol problems. But what is that? Is it a good thing? Let's take a look:

Alcohol detoxification, commonly referred to as "detox," is the process of eliminating alcohol from the body of someone who has been consuming it regularly and in large amounts. This is often the first step in treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) and is crucial for individuals who are dependent on alcohol.

## **How Does Alcohol Detox Work?**

- 
**Medical Supervision**: Detox is typically conducted under medical supervision, especially for those with severe alcohol dependence, to manage withdrawal symptoms safely.
​

- 
**Withdrawal Symptoms Management**: During detox, individuals may experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, tremors, nausea, and in severe cases, seizures. Medical professionals may administer medications, such as benzodiazepines, to alleviate these symptoms and ensure safety.
​

- 
**Nutritional Support**: Proper nutrition and hydration are essential during detox to help the body recover and stabilise.
​

- 
**Emotional and Psychological Support**: Detox programs often include counselling and support to address the emotional and psychological aspects of alcohol dependence.
​

- 
**Transition to Further Treatment**: After detox, individuals are usually encouraged to continue with a comprehensive treatment plan that includes therapy and support groups to maintain sobriety.
