# Alcohol Misuse Medications

Let me share some important information about medications that can support changes in drinking - it's a topic that requires careful consideration, and must be discussed with a medical professional.

### Available Medications:

**Naltrexone**

* Reduces alcohol cravings
* Blocks pleasurable effects of drinking
* Available as daily pill or monthly injection
* Can be very effective with proper support



#### **Accamprosate**

* Helps restore brain chemistry balance
* Reduces withdrawal symptoms
* Supports long-term sobriety
* Often used after initial detox



#### **Disulfiram**

* Creates unpleasant reaction to alcohol
* Acts as a deterrent to drinking
* Requires strong commitment
* Must be used with caution



### **Important Understanding:**

* Medications aren't magic solutions
* Work best as part of broader support plan
* Require medical supervision
* Different options work for different people



### **Key Considerations:**

* Medical assessment is essential
* Regular monitoring is important
* Support systems increase success
* Lifestyle changes still needed



While medications can be helpful tools, they work best when combined with other forms of support, including counselling, lifestyle changes, and understanding your relationship with alcohol.
