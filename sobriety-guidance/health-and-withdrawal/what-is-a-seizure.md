# What is a seizure?

An alcoholic seizure is a type of seizure that can occur in individuals who are dependent on alcohol, particularly during withdrawal from alcohol. Here are some key points about alcoholic seizures you should be aware of.

## Key Points

### Definition:

Alcoholic seizures are seizures that occur as a result of alcohol withdrawal, typically in individuals with alcohol use disorder. ​

### Timing:

They usually occur within 6 to 48 hours after the last drink, as the body reacts to the absence of alcohol. ​

### Symptoms:

Symptoms can include convulsions, shaking, loss of consciousness, and muscle stiffness. They may resemble generalised tonic-clonic seizures. ​

### Risk Factors:

Individuals with a history of heavy drinking, previous withdrawal seizures, or a history of delirium tremens (a severe form of alcohol withdrawal) are at higher risk. ​

### Treatment:

Treatment often involves medical supervision, and medications such as benzodiazepines may be used to manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent seizures.

**Advisory:**

If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal or seizures, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately, as this can be a serious, life-threatening condition.
