# What if I try to quit and fail? Won't that make me feel worse?

This fear of failure keeps many people from even attempting sobriety. However, understanding the nature of change can transform how you view this journey:

## Understanding Change:

- 
Change is rarely linear

- 
Progress isn't always visible day-to-day

- 
Learning from setbacks is part of the process

- 
Each attempt builds resilience and knowledge

- 
"Failure" is feedback, not defeat

## The Reality of Recovery:

Most successful sober people had multiple attempts before lasting sobriety. Each attempt:

- 
Builds awareness of triggers

- 
Develops coping mechanisms

- 
Strengthens motivation

- 
Reveals areas needing support

- 
Provides valuable learning experiences

## What "Failure" Actually Teaches:

- 
**Trigger Identification:**

- 
Social situations that challenge sobriety

- 
Emotional states that prompt drinking

- 
Environmental factors that increase risk

- 
Relationships that need boundaries

- 
Times of day/week that are challenging
​

- 
**Coping Mechanism Assessment:**

- 
Which strategies worked

- 
What additional support is needed

- 
How to prepare for challenges

- 
Where to focus personal growth

- 
What resources to gather
​

- 
**Support System Development:**

- 
Who provides reliable support

- 
What professional help is needed

- 
Which relationships need adjustment

- 
What communities to connect with

- 
How to communicate needs clearly

## Building Resilience:

Each attempt at sobriety strengthens:

- 
Self-awareness

- 
Coping skills

- 
Support networks

- 
Understanding of addiction

- 
Commitment to change

- 
Personal growth tools

## Moving Forward:

Instead of viewing past attempts as failures:

- 
Celebrate the sober days you've had

- 
Document lessons learned

- 
Identify new resources and support

- 
Adjust your approach based on experience

- 
Focus on progress, not perfection
