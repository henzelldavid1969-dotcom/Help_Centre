# Going Solo.

Deciding whether to stop drinking on your own or with others in similar situations can significantly impact your journey. Here are some considerations to make:

## Doing It Alone

### 1. Self-Reliance:

Some people prefer the independence of managing their sobriety without external support, which can foster personal growth and resilience.

### 2. Flexibility:

You can set your own pace and choose your methods without needing to align with a group.

### 3. Personal Reflection:

Working alone may allow for deeper self-reflection and understanding of personal triggers and motivations.

## Doing It with Others

### 1. Shared Experiences:

Being part of a group provides a sense of community and understanding, as members share similar struggles and successes.

### 2. Accountability:

Regular interactions with others can enhance accountability, making it easier to stay committed to your goals.

### 3. Emotional Support:

Having a support network can provide encouragement and reduce feelings of isolation, which is often crucial in recovery.

### 4. Resource Sharing:

Group members can share valuable resources, coping strategies, and insights that may not be available when working alone.

## Conclusion

While some may find success in solitary efforts, many people benefit from the support and camaraderie of a group. Engaging with others can provide motivation, accountability, and emotional support, making the journey to sobriety more manageable. Ultimately, the best approach depends on your personal preferences and circumstances.
