# Should I just go to AA

AA is a very well known approach for enabling addiction recovery. It is active throughout the world and has meetings and support in practically every city.

Deciding whether Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the right fit for you involves self-reflection and understanding what AA offers.

Here are some steps and considerations to help you make this decision:



**Self-Assessment**

* AA provides a self-assessment tool that can help you evaluate your relationship with alcohol. You can find this tool on the [AA website](https://www.aa.org/self-assessment).
* Reflect on questions such as: Do you find it difficult to control your drinking? Has drinking affected your relationships or work? ​



**Understanding AA's Approach**

* AA is a fellowship of individuals who share their experiences and support each other in maintaining sobriety.
* It follows a 12-step program that emphasises personal growth, accountability, and community support. ​



**Consider Your Needs and Preferences**

* If you value peer support and are open to sharing your experiences in a group setting, AA might be beneficial.
* Consider whether you are comfortable with the spiritual aspect of the 12-step program, although AA is not religious and welcomes people of all beliefs. ​



**Attend a Meeting**

* You can attend an AA meeting to see if the environment and approach resonate with you. Meetings are open to anyone who wants to stop drinking.
* Learn more about what to expect at your first meeting [here](https://www.cumberlandheights.org/blogs/introduction-to-aa-meetings-what-to-expect-on-your-first-visit/). ​



**Consult with a Professional**

* Speaking with a healthcare provider or counsellor can provide additional insights into whether AA might be a good fit for your recovery journey.



Whilst Phenomenal and AA have slightly different approaches they are both focussed ultimately on the same thing: recovery and sobriety.

Accessing one certainly does not discount the other.

If you'd like to know more about Phenomenal, how it works and how it might help you be sure to reach out in the chat or via email.

Ultimately, the decision to join AA is personal, and only you can determine if it aligns with your goals and needs. Exploring resources and attending a meeting can provide clarity and help you make an informed choice.
