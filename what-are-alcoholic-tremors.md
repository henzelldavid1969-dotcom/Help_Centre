# What are alcoholic tremors?

Alcoholic tremors, also known as alcohol withdrawal tremors or hand tremors ("the shakes"), are involuntary shaking movements that can occur in individuals who are dependent on alcohol, particularly during withdrawal. 

Here are some key points about alcoholic tremors:

## Key Points

### Definition: 

Alcoholic tremors are rhythmic shaking movements, often affecting the hands, that occur as a result of alcohol withdrawal.
​

### Timing: 

They typically manifest within 6 to 48 hours after the last drink, as the body reacts to the absence of alcohol.
​

### Symptoms: 

The tremors can vary in severity and may be accompanied by other withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sweating, and nausea.
​

### Risk Factors: 

Individuals with a history of heavy alcohol consumption, previous withdrawal symptoms, or a history of alcohol use disorder are at higher risk for developing tremors during withdrawal.
​

### Treatment: 

Management often involves medical supervision, and medications such as benzodiazepines may be prescribed to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and reduce tremors.

**Advisory:**

If you or someone you know is experiencing alcoholic tremors, it is important to seek medical attention, as this can indicate a serious withdrawal condition.
