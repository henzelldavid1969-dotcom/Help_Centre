# How do I know if I'm drinking too much?

"Am I drinking too much?" - It's a question that takes courage to ask, and it's one many of us face at different points in our lives. Instead of focusing on strict definitions or diagnoses, let's explore some gentle signs that might suggest it's time to examine your relationship with alcohol:

## Signs to Notice:

### Changes in Your Drinking Patterns

Remember, acknowledging these thoughts doesn't mean you have a "problem" - it means you're being mindful about your wellbeing. Many people I work with started their journey simply by honouring these quiet questions they had about their drinking.

Through my experience helping others navigate similar concerns, I've learned that the most telling indicator isn't necessarily how much you drink, but how your drinking makes you feel about yourself and your choices.

If you're asking these questions, you're not alone. I've helped many people explore their relationship with alcohol in a supportive, judgment-free environment and discover a path that feels right for them.
