# Do I need to stop drinking or can I just cut back?

The decision to stop drinking completely or to cut back is deeply personal, and there's no universal "right" answer. Through my experience supporting others on their journeys, I've found that what matters most is understanding what feels authentic and achievable for you.

## **Consider These Questions:**

- 
**How Does Alcohol Fit Into Your Life?**

- 
Can you reliably stick to limits when you drink?

- 
Do you feel in control of your drinking choices?

- 
Are you able to enjoy social situations without alcohol?

- 
**What's Motivating Your Change?**

- 
Are you looking to improve your health or relationships?

- 
Do you want more clarity and energy?

- 
Are you concerned about your current drinking patterns?

- 
**What Happens When You Try to Control Your Drinking?**

- 
Can you easily take breaks from alcohol?

- 
Do you find yourself drinking more than planned?

- 
Have previous attempts to moderate been challenging?

## **Signs Complete Abstinence Might Be Worth Considering:**

- 
Finding it difficult to stick to drinking limits

- 
Experiencing anxiety or strong urges between drinks

- 
Feeling unable to say no once you start

- 
Previous attempts to moderate haven't worked

## **Signs Moderation Might Work For You:**

- 
Being able to take alcohol-free days easily

- 
Naturally drinking within guidelines without struggle

- 
Having a healthy relationship with alcohol overall

- 
Clear ability to stop after one or two drinks

Remember, this isn't about what you "should" do - it's about finding what works best for your wellbeing and the life you want to create. Many people find that taking a break from alcohol altogether provides clarity about which path feels right for them.
