# Why is Phenomenal so effective?

Effective? I would say that, wouldn't I?

But here's the thing: our 98% success rate comes from combining professional expertise with lived experience. That is to say, literally 98% of people using the program have achieved long-term sobriety.

This isn't about willpower or white-knuckling your way through cravings. The program uses evidence-based techniques, personalised support, and our unique THRIVE Sobriety System to make sobriety feel natural and achievable - not like something you have to endure.

### **What Makes Phenomenal Different:**

**Structured Yet Flexible** – Follow our proven 12-week THRIVE System at your own pace, with lifetime access to all materials and community support.

**Real Support When You Need It** – Weekly group coaching calls, personalized guidance, and a vibrant member community mean you're never walking this path alone.

**Evidence-Based Techniques** – Over 140 proven activities and strategies that address triggers, rebuild patterns, and create sustainable change—not just theory, but practical tools you'll actually use.

**Engaging & Rewarding** – Progress tracking, milestone celebrations, and community challenges keep you motivated and make sobriety something you look forward to, not dread.

**Professional + Personal** – I'm a recovered alcoholic and qualified addiction specialist. I've been exactly where you are, and I've helped hundreds of others transform their lives.

Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on what you're giving up, Phenomenal creates lasting change by helping you build new patterns, reclaim your agency, and discover what becomes possible when alcohol no longer controls your choices. We celebrate every milestone of your journey because transformation deserves recognition, not shame.

The difference? You're not just stopping drinking—you're actively creating the life you actually want to live. That's why it works. That's why it lasts.
