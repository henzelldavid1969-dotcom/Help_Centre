# How do I know if I'm drinking dependently?

If you're wondering about dependent drinking, you're not alone. It's a question that requires courage to ask, and it's important to approach it with understanding rather than judgment. Through my experience supporting others, I've observed several key patterns worth considering:

## Physical Signs to Notice:

- 
Morning shakes or anxiety that ease with alcohol

- 
Needing to drink more to feel the same effects

- 
Finding it difficult to stop once you start

- 
Physical discomfort when not drinking

## Daily Life Changes:

- 
Planning activities around drinking

- 
Drinking earlier in the day than intended

- 
Missing work or family commitments

- 
Financial strain from alcohol spending

## Emotional Patterns:

- 
Using alcohol to manage stress or anxiety

- 
Feeling unable to socialise without drinking

- 
Experiencing guilt or shame about drinking

- 
Finding it hard to imagine life without alcohol

## Relationship Impact:

- 
Others expressing concern about your drinking

- 
Hiding or minimising your alcohol consumption

- 
Relationships becoming strained

- 
Preferring to drink alone

## Control Issues:

- 
Difficulty having alcohol-free days

- 
Drinking more than you plan to

- 
Failed attempts to cut down

- 
Finding reasons/excuses to drink

Understanding dependent drinking isn't about labelling yourself - it's about recognising when alcohol might be taking more control than you'd like. If you're relating to several of these patterns, it's important to know that dependent drinking is a medical condition that requires proper support for safe recovery.

Many people successfully overcome dependent drinking with the right help. The key is reaching out for professional support to ensure a safe journey to recovery.
