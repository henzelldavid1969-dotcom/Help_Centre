# How do I reset my password?

Forgot your password? 

Join the club - we've all been there! 🤦‍♂️ 

Here's how to get back to your happy place:

- 
Click "Forgot Password" (it's like the "Help!" button, but for passwords)

- 
Type in your email (the one you use, not the one you abandoned in 2010! 😉)

- 
We'll shoot you a reset email faster than you can say "where's my password?" ⚡

- 
Create your new password (maybe save it somewhere this time? Notes app for the win! 📝)

- 
Log in and boom - you're back! 🎉

**Pro tip**: If you're like me and forget passwords weekly, consider a password manager. It's like having a really organised friend who never forgets anything! 🗂️
