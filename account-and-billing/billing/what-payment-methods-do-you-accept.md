# Payment Methods

We're like that friend who uses every payment app - we take pretty much everything! 🎯

* **Credit/debit cards**  - (Visa, Mastercard, Amex - if it's plastic, we probably accept it!)
* **PayPal** (for when you're feeling extra secure 🔒)
* **Bank transfer** (old school but gold school - for annual subscriptions)
* **Apple Pay/Google Pay** (for when you're too comfy on the couch to reach for your wallet 🛋️)



**Real talk:** Someone once asked if we accept cryptocurrency.

Not yet, but never say never! 😄
