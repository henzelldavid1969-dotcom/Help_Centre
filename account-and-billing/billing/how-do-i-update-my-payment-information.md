# How do I update my payment information?

Time for a wallet refresh? 

Maybe that card expired, or you got a shiny new one? 

Let's get you sorted! 🔄

- 
Head to Billing Settings (it's like your digital wallet)

- 
Find "Payment Methods" (where all the money magic happens ✨)

- 
Add your new card or payment method (as easy as online shopping!)

- 
Make it your default if you want (like picking your favorite coffee shop ☕)

- 
Clear out old payment methods (like cleaning out your actual wallet, but less receipts!)

**Fun fact:** Most people update their payment info while watching TV - multitasking at its finest! 📺
