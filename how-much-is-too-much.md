# How much is too much?

"How much is too much?" - It's a common question, but the answer isn't as simple as following generic guidelines. While health organizations provide recommendations, what's more important is understanding how alcohol affects YOUR life and wellbeing.

**Let's look at some official guidelines as a starting point:**

- 
UK health experts suggest no more than 14 units weekly (about 6 pints of beer or 6 medium glasses of wine)

- 
This should be spread across several days, with alcohol-free days in between

**But here's what's really worth considering:**

- 
Do you regularly exceed these amounts without meaning to?

- 
Do you find it challenging to stick to your own drinking limits?

- 
Are you questioning whether your current consumption feels right for you?

## **Signs Your Drinking Might Be Worth Examining:**

- 
You're consistently drinking more than you plan to

- 
You feel anxious about social events without alcohol

- 
You're having trouble taking alcohol-free days

- 
Your drinking is affecting your sleep, mood, or relationships

- 
You're concerned about your consumption level

Remember, these guidelines are just that - guidelines. What matters most is your personal relationship with alcohol and how it impacts your life. Many people I work with found themselves questioning their drinking long before reaching any official "threshold" of concern.

Through my experience helping others navigate these questions, I've learned that the most important indicator isn't necessarily how much you drink, but how your drinking makes you feel about yourself and your choices.

If you're asking this question, it might be worth exploring your relationship with alcohol in a supportive, judgment-free environment. I've helped many people gain clarity about their drinking and make positive changes that feel right for them.
