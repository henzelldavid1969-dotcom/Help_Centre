# Why is Phenomenal so effective?

Effective? I would say that, wouldn't I?

Our 98% success rate comes from combining professional expertise with lived experience. That is to say literally 98% of people using the program have achieved long term sobriety.

The program uses evidence-based techniques, personalised support, and our unique THRIVE Sobriety System to make sobriety feel natural and achievable. 

Unlike traditional approaches, Phenomenal creates lasting change by focusing on building new patterns while celebrating every milestone of your journey.
