# Specific Guidelines

#### Discussing Relapses

Relapses are a common part of recovery journeys. If you've experienced a relapse:

**You Can:**

* Share that you've relapsed and need support
* Discuss your feelings, triggers, and what you're learning
* Ask for accountability and encouragement moving forward
* Talk about your plan to get back on track

**Please Avoid:**

* Detailed descriptions of using (what, how much, where, etc.)
* Glorifying or romanticising the experience
* Encouraging others to relapse or minimising its seriousness
* Sharing while currently under the influence

#### Talking About Mental Health

Mental health and addiction often intersect. We welcome discussions about:

* Your experiences with mental health challenges
* How mental health affects your recovery
* Strategies for managing co-occurring conditions
* Resources and support systems that help

**Important:** We are not a substitute for professional mental health care. If you're in crisis, please contact emergency services or a crisis helpline immediately.

#### Crisis Support

  * National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988 (US)
