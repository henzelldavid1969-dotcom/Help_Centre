# Creating a Positive Community

#### Welcome New Members

When someone joins:

* Say hello and introduce yourself
* Share encouragement for their journey
* Offer to answer questions
* Make them feel like they belong

#### Celebrate Milestones

Recovery is worth celebrating:

* Acknowledge days, weeks, months, and years of sobriety
* Celebrate other victories (new jobs, relationships, achievements)
* Support members through difficult milestones (anniversaries of loss, etc.)
* Remember that every day sober is an achievement

#### Offer Thoughtful Support

When someone is struggling:

* Listen without judgment
* Validate their feelings
* Share your own experience if relevant
* Avoid prescriptive advice unless requested
* Remind them of their strengths and progress

#### Practice Gratitude

Gratitude strengthens recovery:

* Share what you're grateful for
* Thank members who've helped you
* Acknowledge the gift of community
* Recognise growth in yourself and others
