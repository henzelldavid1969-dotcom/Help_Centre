# Special Considerations

#### Anonymity & Identity

You can:

* Use your real name or a username
* Share as much or as little about yourself as feels comfortable
* Change your level of openness as you feel safe to do so

Please respect others' choices about anonymity and don't try to identify members outside the community.

#### Different Approaches to Recovery

We recognise that people find recovery through many paths:

* 12-step programs
* SMART Recovery
* Faith-based approaches
* Therapy and medical treatment
* Harm reduction
* Other evidence-based methods

You're welcome to share what works for you while respecting that others may choose different paths.

#### Trigger Warnings

When sharing content that might be triggering, please use a content warning:

* Mention "CW:" or "TW:" at the beginning of your post
* Briefly note the topic (e.g., "CW: relapse discussion")
* Give members the choice to engage or not

Common triggers include: detailed relapse stories, trauma, loss, self-harm, and graphic content.
