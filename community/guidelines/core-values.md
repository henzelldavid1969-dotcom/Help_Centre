# Core Values

### Our Core Values

#### 1. **Dignity & Respect**

Every member deserves to be treated with dignity, regardless of where they are in their journey. We honour each person's unique path and lived experience.

#### 2. **Authenticity**

We encourage honest, vulnerable sharing within appropriate boundaries. Real transformation happens when we can be genuine about our struggles and successes.

#### 3. **Accountability**

We support each other in staying accountable to our sobriety goals while recognising that accountability includes both compassion and challenge.

#### 4. **Purpose & Meaning**

Following motivational principles, we believe recovery is strengthened when connected to personal meaning and purpose beyond simply abstaining from substances.

#### 5. **Confidentiality**

What's shared in this community stays in this community. We protect each other's privacy and stories.
