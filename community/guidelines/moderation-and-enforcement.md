# Moderation & Enforcement

#### How We Moderate

Our community is moderated by trained staff who:

* Monitor discussions for guideline violations
* Respond to member reports and concerns
* Provide guidance when guidelines are unclear
* Take action when necessary to maintain community safety

#### Reporting Concerns

If you see content or behaviour that violates these guidelines:

1. **Use the Report Feature** - Click the three-dot menu on any post and select "Report"
2. **Be Specific** - Explain which guideline is being violated and why
3. **Don't Engage** - Avoid escalating the situation publicly
4. **Trust the Process** - We review all reports promptly

#### Consequences

Violations may result in:

**First Offence (Minor):**

* Private warning and education
* Request to edit or remove content
* Temporary restriction on posting

**Repeated or Serious Offences:**

* Temporary suspension from the community
* Removal from specific spaces or features
* Permanent ban from the community

**Immediate Ban:**

* Threats of violence or harm
* Sharing illegal content
* Severe harassment or bullying
* Soliciting members for harmful purposes

We handle each situation individually and prioritise community safety while offering grace for genuine mistakes.
