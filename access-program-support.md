# Access program support.

If at any time you need some technical or administrative assistance don't be shy, reach out and we will do our best to help.

I say "we", I mean either myself or **Solly**, our Sober Concierge who lives in the widget at the bottom of every page:

### What can Solly do to help?

Solly is continuously trained on the content of the course and this help centre. He even makes a note of all the times he has helped other people and can refer back to these to help you.

He's pretty smart, but a little shy.

### Here's some of the things Solly can help you with:

- 
The content of the program, where things are and how it works in case you get confused.

- 
A whole myriad of useful guidance and advice about alcohol and drinking - try him - you'll be amazed.

- 
Solly can always put you through to a human (that's what he calls me!) and we can take it from there.
