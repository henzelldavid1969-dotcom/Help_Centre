# What happens after I cancel?

We'll be sad to see you go (like when your favourite show ends 📺), but here's what happens next:

- 
You keep full access until your billing period ends (we're not those people who take away your Netflix mid-show!)

- 
Zero surprise charges (we hate those more than you do!)

- 
Your data stays safe for 30 days (like keeping your spot in a book 📚)

- 
Changed your mind? Welcome back anytime within 30 days (no awkwardness, promise!)

- 
Pro tip: Download anything you want to keep (like saving photos before getting a new phone 📱)

Remember that time you cancelled your gym membership and they made it super difficult? Yeah, we're not like that AT ALL! 😅
