# Refunds

### Refunds

We offer a **7-Day Satisfaction Guarantee** on all program purchases. If within 7 days of your purchase date you feel the program is not right for you, you may request a full refund provided that ALL of the following conditions are met:

* You have accessed less than 20% of the program content
* You have not downloaded any workbooks, materials, or resources
* You have not attended any live coaching sessions or group calls (where applicable)



### Important

Refund requests must be submitted in writing to [hello@phenomenalsobriety.com](mailto:hello@phenomenalsobriety.com) within the 7-day window. After this period, or once any materials have been downloaded or significant content accessed, **all sales are final** due to the digital nature of our content.\
