Managing your purchases and subscriptions in Mighty Networks is simple. Whether you need to update billing, cancel a subscription, or download invoices, the sections below explain how to do each task.

## Viewing and Managing Your Purchases

To view and manage your subscriptions:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Click your profile picture in the upper-right corner when logged in on a web browser, then go to "Plans and Access" in your profile menu.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## How to Cancel a Subscription

Canceling a subscription is easy. Choose the instructions that match how you purchased the subscription.

{% step %}
### For Subscriptions Purchased on the Web or Mobile Web

{% hint style="info" %}
Important Note: If you have questions about billing or need a refund, contact your Host first. Hosts manage payments through Stripe. If you still need help, you can reach out to the Mighty Networks team.
{% endhint %}

## How to Move Between Subscription Plans

If your Host offers multiple Plans, you can move between eligible Plans on web or iOS without canceling and rejoining.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### On web

* Go to Personal Settings > Plans and Access.
* Select your current Plan.
* Click Change Plan and choose an available Plan.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### On iOS

* Open the Network's iOS app and log in.
* Tap your profile picture in the bottom-right corner.
* Select "Plans and Access" and choose the subscription you'd like to change.
* Scroll to the bottom and tap "Change Plan".
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Things to know

* For upgrades, you will be charged and moved at the end of your billing cycle. You can choose a billing interval (monthly or annual) if available.
* Downgrades take effect at the next billing cycle.
* If you move to a plan that is the same price, the change will happen immediately.
* You cannot move yourself while on a free trial.
* If you move to a plan with a free trial, you will bypass the trial and begin paying immediately.
* You can only move between visible Plans that you are eligible to access.

## Changing Your Billing Interval (Monthly or Annual)

If your Host offers both monthly and annual Plans, you can switch between them.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
* On the web, go to Personal Settings > Plans and Access.
* Select the Plan you want to switch.
* Choose Switch to Annual/Monthly.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Things to Remember

* You can't change your billing interval during a free trial. Wait until your trial ends or cancel the subscription.
* The switch will take effect on your next billing date, and you'll be billed for the new Plan then.
* If you were invited to a free Plan by the Host, this option won't apply.

## Downloading Invoices

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
* Click your profile picture in the upper-right corner.
* Go to Plans and Access.
* Select your Paid Plan.
* Under "Invoices", find your last 10 invoices.
* Click "View Invoice" to download.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## What Happens If Your Host Moves You to a New Plan?

* You'll receive an email, in-app notification, and push notification (if enabled) about the move.
* You may need to add billing details or verify the purchase.
* If your Host moves you to a Paid Plan and you don't verify or update your billing information within 7 days, the move will be canceled, and you'll stay on your current Plan.

## Understanding Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)

For some credit card purchases, banks require Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to protect against fraud.

### When is SCA required?

SCA is needed for new purchases online, such as when your Host moves you to a new Plan. (Renewals don't require SCA.)

### What happens if SCA is needed?

* You'll receive a message prompting you to verify your billing information.
* A red banner will appear when you log in, reminding you to complete verification.
* You'll have 7 days to verify your card details before the move is canceled.
* If the move is canceled, you'll remain on your current Plan, and your Host will be notified.

## Adding a Tax ID for Tax-Exempt Purchases

In some countries (EU, UK, New Zealand, and Australia), Hosts may allow you to add a Tax ID to your account for tax-exempt purchases.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
* Click your profile picture in the top right corner > Personal Settings > Account > Billing.
* Enter your Tax ID number.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
