{% hint style="warning" %}
Mighty Networks only allows one credit card for all subscription plans under the same account. Members cannot use different credit cards or payment methods for different subscriptions within the same Network. However, if a member has accounts in multiple Mighty Networks, they can add a different payment method for each Network.
