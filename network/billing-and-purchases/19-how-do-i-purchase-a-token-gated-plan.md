<summary>What is a Crypto Wallet?</summary>

It's a software wallet that can be used to interact with a blockchain and decentralized applications, usually in the form of a browser extension or mobile app. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are two popular Crypto Wallet examples. Check out this helpful video on how to set up a wallet.

<summary>How would I start exploring the world of NFTs?</summary>

A common place to start is visiting an NFT marketplace (OpenSea is a popular destination) and exploring your options from there.

You can also visit OpenSea's learning center to get a step-by-step guide to purchasing a NFT.

From there, you'll be able to easily browse and purchase NFTs (most of them existing on the Ethereum blockchain) using your Crypto Wallet.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We continually check that you still have access to the required token. If the gate requirements are no longer met (for example by selling, transferring, or losing access), you'll no longer have access to the Plan. Both you and your Network Hosts will receive a notification if this happens.

For gating based on token amounts, we do not currently support combining token amounts across multiple wallets.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Disconnecting a Wallet</summary>

If you need to disconnect your Wallet at any time, visit Your Profile > Account > Web3 Wallets and select the Wallet you would like to disconnect.

If you are a member of any Plans that require a Token to access them and you remove the Wallet qualifying your membership, you will be removed from the Plan. Our system checks your wallet hourly to ensure that you still have the required tokens for membership.
