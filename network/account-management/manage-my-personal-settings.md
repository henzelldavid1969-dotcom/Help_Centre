# Manage my personal settings

You will find your Personal Settings by selecting your profile photo in the upper right corner.

In your Personal Settings, you'll find a few options to manage your account.

If you're on a plan, you'll see "Plans and Access" at the top, where you can easily manage your subscriptions in the Mighty Network.

## Account

Here, you can update your email address and password, verify your email, change your billing information, manage your Zoom account (if your Host has allowed members to create Events), and adjust your cookie settings.

## Edit Profile

Make edits and changes to your profile.

## Notifications

Decide what notifications you want to receive and how you'd like to receive them.

## Appearance and Sounds

Choose between dark/light mode, turn off autoplaying of GIFs, and select which notifications should include sound.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: This option prevents autoplaying in most areas where GIFs appear. A few additional areas (including Space Detail and Network About pages) will be included in future releases.
{% endhint %}

## Chat

Turn the option on or off for other members to start private chats with you.

## Streaks

Turn off or on your Public Streak Calendar.

## Feedback and Info

Access the Help Center, privacy policies, and terms of service.

## Download the App

You'll find a QR code to easily download the app. Open the camera on your phone, point it at the code, and get a direct link.

## Invite

If your Host allows, you can invite others to join via email or by uploading a CSV of your contacts.

If your Host has enabled the Ambassador program, you'll see it here as well.
