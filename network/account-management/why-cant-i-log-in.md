# Why cant I log in?

If you're having trouble logging into your Mighty Network, check the sections below for common causes and solutions.

<details>

<summary>Common Login Issues</summary>

* **Correct URL:** Make sure you're using the correct URL for the Mighty Network you're trying to log into.
* **Correct Email Address:** Use the email address associated with your account when you first signed up. If you initially signed up using Social Sign In (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Apple), try those options to log in. If you'd like to switch to signing in with your email, you'll need to reset your password.
* **Separate Logins for Each Network:** Every Mighty Network is standalone, meaning you'll need a separate profile and login for each one you're part of. You can use the same login information for each network if you prefer.

<summary>Switching Between Networks</summary>

**On Mobile**

Once you log in to a Mighty Network app, you can switch between networks without needing to log in again.

Tap the three-line menu in the top left corner

Tap "Switch Networks"

**On Web**

Once logged in, you can hop between networks by going directly to the URL in your web browser. For easy navigation, consider bookmarking the landing pages of all the Mighty Networks you're a member of.

<summary>Resetting Your Password</summary>

**Important Notes**

You can only reset your password through a web browser, not through the mobile app.

**Forgot Password?**

Open a web browser and go to the Sign In page of your Mighty Network.

Click the "Forgot password?" link.

Enter your email address and click "Send Email."

The password reset email is valid for one hour, but you can send yourself as many reset emails as needed.

If You Don't Receive the Email

Search your inbox for "password".

Check your spam and junk folders.

If you're still having trouble, email: hello@phenomenalsobriety.com

Why was I logged out of my Mighty Network?

For security, login sessions on both web and mobile apps auto-renew regularly as long as you've accessed your Network in recent months. If it's been a while since your last visit, you may be asked to log in again.

<summary>Account Disabled?</summary>

Possible reasons your account was disabled:

* **Banned by Host or Moderator:** A Network Host or Moderator may have banned your account.
* **Flagged for Spam:** Your account might have been flagged for spam due to sending repeated messages.

If you believe your account was disabled by mistake, email: hello@phenomenalsobriety.com and the team will take a look. If your account was banned by a Host or Moderator, that decision cannot be overturned by Mighty Networks support.
