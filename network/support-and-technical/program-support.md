# Program Support

Accessing support in Phenomenal is simple. Plus, you have a couple of options to access the help you need.

### Option 1: Platform Support

This user support is baked into the Mighty Network, the platform that runs Phenomenal. To access it lick on your profile image and choose "Help Centre" that will open a help "widget" from where you can browse a wide range of help topics or ask for help.

### Option 2: Phenomenal Help Centre

In addition to the method above, all members can access the dedicated Phenomenal Help Centre by clicking the link in the menu sidebar.

Both options cover platform support but the Phenomenal Help Centre also includes a host of sobriety guidance and advice.
