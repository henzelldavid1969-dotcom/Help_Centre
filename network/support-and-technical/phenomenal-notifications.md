# Phenomenal Notifications

Notifications surface updates about activity in your Mighty Network.

Change what you're notified about and how you receive notifications by clicking your profile picture -> Personal Settings -> Notifications.

## Five Ways You Receive Notifications

You can receive notifications through five different channels: in-app, email, desktop, mobile push, and pop-up notifications.

* In-app notifications: By default, you will receive notifications based on your notification settings via the bell icon.
* Email notifications (on by default): If you have Email Updates turned on in notification settings, you will receive email notifications at the email address you used to join your Mighty Network.
* Mobile push notifications (off by default): These notifications will appear on your mobile device when activity happens in your Mighty Network.
* Desktop notifications: If you would like to enable desktop notifications, check out this article.
* Pop-up notifications (on by default): These notifications appear temporarily in the lower right corner of the screen for direct chat messages and Space Chat Messages.

If you would like to turn on or off Space Chat Message notifications for all your Spaces: Personal Settings -> Notifications -> Space Chat Messages. To mute Space Chat Messages for a specific Space: select the three-dot menu next to the Space and click "Mute Chat".

## Default Notifications and Settings When You First Create Your Account

When you first create your Mighty Networks account, defaults are:

## How to Enable or Disable Email and Mobile Push Notifications

### Email Notifications

Email notifications are on by default. To toggle email notifications on or off: profile picture -> Personal Settings -> Notifications, then toggle Email Updates.

<details>

<summary>Why does it say that I'm unsubscribed?</summary>

A member can be marked as unsubscribed for a few reasons:

* The email provider is flagging "@mn.co" email notifications.
* The email provider's settings have been updated, so they flag our email notifications.
* The email provider's filters pick up the "@mn.co" email address and bounce the email.
* The email provider has "@mn.co" on a spam list, which flags our email delivery system.
* The member accidentally marked our emails as spam.

To help prevent this, safelist @mn.co emails within your email provider.

If you need to resubscribe, you will see a "Contact Support" button in your notification settings. Tap that button, or email help@mightynetworks.com and the team will help you resubscribe.

</details>

### Choose Email Frequency

You can choose Daily Digest (one email per day) or have notifications sent as activity happens. The Daily Digest is enabled by default.

* The Daily Digest is sent at the end of each day with a summary of your unread notifications. Time-sensitive notifications (like event reminders) may still be sent in real-time.
* If you click an in-app notification, it is marked read and will not appear in the Daily Digest.

Daily Digest may include combinations of:

* New Posts & Activity: New content, comments, @Mentions, one-on-one Private Chat messages, plus Event and Poll-related updates
* New Course Content: Published and unlocked Course content
* Welcome Invites to Mighty Network and Spaces
* Notify All Members
* New Members joined: Members with similar Custom Fields or near you
* Ambassador Program Updates: Referred Members joined, new Ambassador level reached

Notifications that bypass the Daily Digest and are sent in real-time:

* Message all members from Hosts
* Your Host just went Live
* Event Reminders
* User Reported
* Welcome Checklist Reminder

### Mobile Push Notifications

Mobile Push notifications are off by default.

To enable Mobile Push notifications:

1. Download the Mighty Networks App. When logged in on the web, click the Download App button and enter your mobile number to receive an SMS link to the app.
2. After downloading the app, you'll be prompted to enable Mobile Push notifications.

Manage mobile push notifications: profile picture -> Personal Settings -> Notifications, then toggle Mobile Push.

If you previously turned off Mobile Push via your device settings or denied permission, open your device settings to allow the Mighty Networks app to send Mobile Push notifications.

## Select Notifications as Read or Unread

Mark individual notifications as read or unread by selecting the three-dot menu next to each notification.
