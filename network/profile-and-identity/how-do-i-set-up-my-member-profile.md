# How do I set up my Member Profile?

Setting up your member profile is a great first step after joining a community that's built on Mighty Networks. Your profile helps you build relationships by sharing interests, timezone/location, badges, profession, and more. It also provides a record of your activity - where you've posted, commented, and reacted.

Below are expandable sections that cover what you can add and other profile features.

<summary>What You Can Add to Your Profile</summary>

To edit your profile, navigate to your picture in the upper right corner - this is your account menu.

Edit profileGo to Personal Settings, then select Edit Profile.

In your profile, you can add:

* A profile photo (minimum size 500 x 500 pixels; will be cropped into a circle). You'll have a default abstract image until you add a photo.
* A cover photo (appears as a horizontal banner on desktop and cropped to a vertical background on mobile - choose an image that can be trimmed).
* A short bio that is fully searchable.
* Your location (optional).
* Your timezone.
* Up to 10 personal links.
* An "About Me" introduction (when filled out it will automatically post in the Global Feed on web so others can comment and welcome you; it won't appear on mobile apps).

A few notes about location:

* If you change your location, posts you posted before will show your previous location. New posts will show your new location moving forward.
* Mighty approximates your location based on platform data. Your location is not visible to other members until you add it to your profile page. Your Host can view both approximated and confirmed locations.

To add personal links, paste the URLs in. Consider adding:

* Social media profiles (the service name and icon will be pulled in automatically).
* YouTube or Vimeo videos (the video title will be pulled in).
* Your personal website.
* Your business website.
* Blog posts you write.
* Publications you've written.

<summary>Other Profile Features</summary>

Your Host may have enabled additional features, such as Custom fields you can add to your profile (for example, profession or interest, chosen from a Host-established list).

You may also see Badges assigned for accomplishments in the Network.

Additionally, you can explore member profiles you may want to connect with. Scrolling over a profile will enlarge it and show the member's mini bio. From there, you can message them, view their profile, or select "Show Similarities".

<summary>Profile Assist</summary>

If your Host has enabled this AI feature, it can help set up your profile - specifically the About Me section.

Selecting "Get Me Started" will ask three simple questions and generate a new profile text. To try again, delete the text in the "About Me" section and repeat.
