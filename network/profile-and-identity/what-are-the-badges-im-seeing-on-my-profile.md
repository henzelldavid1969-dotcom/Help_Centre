Badges are awarded to you by your Host! It means you have accomplished or achieved something that they want to acknowledge publicly.

Everyone in the Mighty Network will be able to see your Badges and you can also click on the Badge to learn more about it.

Selecting "See 7 Members" will show you a list of all other members that have that Badge as well.
