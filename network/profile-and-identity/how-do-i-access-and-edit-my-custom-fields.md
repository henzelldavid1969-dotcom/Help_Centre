# How do I access & edit my custom fields?

Custom Fields live on your profile and help you connect with other members who share similar interests, skills, or goals.

## Where to Find and Edit Your Custom Fields

Depending on how your Host has set up a Custom Field, it may be:

* **Visible and Public** – Shows up on your profile and can be seen by other members.
* **Hidden and Private** – Only visible to you and the Host but not displayed on your profile.

## Editing Your Custom Fields

To update or add responses to Custom Fields:

### Public Profile Fields

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Steps

* Click on your profile photo in the top right corner.
* Click on your profile picture and name.
* Select "Edit" in the top right corner.
* Scroll down to find any public Custom Fields to update them.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Private Custom Fields

<summary>Why can't I see a Custom Field on my profile?</summary>

If a Custom Field is set to private, it will not appear on your profile but can still be accessed when you edit your profile (scroll to the very bottom) or via: profile picture > "Personal Settings" > "Account" > "Private Responses".
