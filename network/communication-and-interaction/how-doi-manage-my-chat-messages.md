<summary><strong>Understanding Your Chat Messages</strong></summary>

Inside of the chat conversation list, you may see different types of messages:

* Group and Private chat messages (direct messages with one or more people)
* Space chat messages (chat conversations happening in Spaces)
* Chat replies (replies to chat messages in Space, private or group chats)

<summary><strong>Muting Chat Messages</strong></summary>

With any of your messages, you can select the three dot menu next to the message to mute that conversation.

After muting a conversation, you won't receive unread indicators for those conversations on the chat icon or in your left-hand navigation.

You can further control what you see in your conversation list:

* Show Muted Conversations: any chat you have muted will show in the conversation list.
* Show Private Messages: only Private Messages will show in your conversation list. Any Space chat will be hidden and you won't receive notifications for those messages in your chat icon. However, you will still be able to see an unread indicator on the left hand navigation panel.
