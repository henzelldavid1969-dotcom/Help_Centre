# How do I use hashtags in Phenomenal?

You can add hashtags to Posts, Chat messages, Articles, comments, Lessons and Sections, Events, and Questions & Polls on web or mobile.

To add one, type a # followed by text - just like on other platforms. You can include multiple hashtags in the same piece of content.

## Hashtag Basics

Hashtags can include letters, numbers, or underscores. They can't include other special characters (like & or $) or extra spaces.

As you type, you'll see a dropdown showing existing hashtags. Continue typing to create a new one.

You may also see a list of Highlighted Hashtags featured in a Space.

## Searching for Hashtags

When you click a hashtag, you'll see search results for all content across the Mighty Network that includes it, sorted by relevance.

To view all results for a hashtag across every Space you have access to, follow these steps:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Open Search in a Space

Click Search in a Space.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click the highlighted hashtag

Click the highlighted hashtag shown in search.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### De-select the Space filter

At the top of the results, de-select the Space filter to Search All Spaces.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Search results include Posts and Articles with hashtags. They don't include messages in Chat Spaces or Private Chats.

You can also sort hashtag results by Top, Newest, or Oldest.
{% endhint %}

## Hashtag Prompt

When creating Posts, Articles, or comments on web (and on iOS or Android for Posts), you'll see a prompt to add a hashtag.

Click the prompt to insert a `#` where your cursor is. As you type, a dropdown will appear showing hashtags - including any highlighted hashtags in that Space.
