# How do I follow a member?

**Follow a member:**

In your Mighty Network, you can follow other members, Hosts, or moderators. To follow someone, navigate to their profile and tap the button that says "Follow." That's it!

Following someone causes more of that person's activity to show up in your feed. You will not see their posts from Spaces you don't have access to.

Adjust notifications for people you followIf you want to change notification settings for members you follow, go to: Profile Photo > Personal Settings > Notifications

From there, toggle on or off the option to be notified whenever people you follow add new posts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Members with limited membership access cannot be followed.
{% endhint %}
