# How do I chat with other members?

Your Mighty Network supports private chats with one member, group chats with up to nine members, and Space chats that happen inside each Space.

Depending on your membership type and your Host's settings, chat features may look different in your Network.

## Types of Chat

### Private or Group Chat

To start a chat with one or more members:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Start a new chat

Click the chat icon in the upper right corner.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add participants

Select + to start a new chat, then search for and select the members you want to include.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Begin

Click Start Chat.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Once a chat is created, you can't add new members - you'll need to start a new one.
{% endhint %}

You can also start a chat with one other member by going to their profile and clicking "Chat".

### Space Chat

Inside each Space, there is the ability to chat with other members. Depending on the type of community you're in, your Host may or may not have this feature turned on.

You'll see Space chat notifications:

* As a number indicator in the left navigation next to the Space
* In your conversation list

You can delete messages by hovering over them and selecting Delete.

## Ways to Interact in Chat

### Voice Notes

You can record and send voice notes (up to 10 minutes) in any type of chat on web or mobile.

Voice notes include:

* Transcripts (with non-English language detection)
* Playback speed control

### @ Mentions

In all types of chats, you can @ mention people by typing "@" followed by their name.

When you mention someone, they'll receive an email, in-app, and mobile push notification.

If you mention someone who doesn't have access to the chat, you'll see an error message:

"This member will not be notified because they are not a member of this Chat."

### Chat Replies

Replies help keep conversations organised and easier to follow.

* You can reply in Space, private, or group chats by selecting the reply icon.
* When enabled, replies trigger email and push notifications.
* Chat threads also appear in your conversation list and begin with "Replies to."

### GIFs and Emoji Reactions

React with GIFs or emojis by selecting the icons in chat.

### Add Files

You can add files from your computer to a chat.

### Start a Conversation (AI-assisted)

If your Host has this AI feature enabled, you'll see the option "Suggest a Conversation Starter".

When opening a direct message or group chat with someone you haven't chatted with before, select Suggest a Conversation Starter. You'll see a draft message based on your profiles and shared interests - you can send it as-is, edit it, or select Try Again for a new suggestion.

## Turning Chat On or Off

Your Host may allow you to turn off individual private chat. If that's available, you'll find the option in:

Personal Settings > Chat

{% hint style="warning" %}
Availability of chat features (including Space chat, voice notes, AI suggestions, and the ability to disable private chat) depends on your Host's settings and your membership type.
{% endhint %}
