# 06 how do i post in a mighty network

As a member, you can share updates in a Mighty Network in a number of ways: Posts, Articles, and Questions or Polls.

Here's how each one works and when to use them.

## How to Create a Post

* On web: go to a Space and start a Post
* On mobile: open the Mighty Networks iOS or Android app and tap the pencil icon at the bottom right.

You can add or create:

* A single photo or up to 6 photos
* A video file
* A video link (YouTube, Vimeo etc..)
* A file
* A question or poll
* Add a background image
* GIF
* Emojis

### Adding Text to Images

If you post a single image, you can add text either:

* Below the image (like a caption), or
* On top of the image (making it the background).

Tap or click the corner prompt to switch between these options.

### Image Sizes

Post images show in either:

* 21:9 (horizontal), or
* 3:4 (vertical).

The 3:4 ratio works best if you want the image as a background. If not, any size will display as uploaded.

Note: very wide or tall images may get cropped, but the full image shows if someone clicks on it.

### Formatting

Posts do not support bold, italics or headers.

If you need those, use an Article instead.

## Create an Article

If your Host allows members to create Articles, you'll see this option in your Create menu.

Articles offer full formatting and support:

* Unlimited photos
* Video embeds (YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook)
* File attachments up to 25 MB each
* Rich media (SoundCloud, Spotify, Typeform, and more)

### Formatting Text

Highlight any text in the editor to:

* Add headers (five levels available)
* Apply bold, italic, strikethrough, or underline
* Add quotes or change text color and highlight color
* Insert hyperlinks

### Adding Rich Media

## Hashtags, GIFs, and Emojis

You can use hashtags, emojis, and GIFs in Posts, Chat, Articles, or comments.

### Hashtags

* Anyone can make hashtags.
* Type "#" plus your text (letters, numbers, or underscores).
* No spaces or special characters (&, $, etc.).
* You can use more than one hashtag per post.
* Hashtags show up in a dropdown as you type.
* Clicking a hashtag shows all posts across the Network that use it.

### GIFs and Emojis

You can add GIFs and emojis to posts, comments, chat, or Articles.

## Comments

You can turn comments on or off for any post you make.

### Toggle comments

2. Toggle comments on or off
