# Using Gifs & Emojis

You can add GIFs and emojis to comments or in private, group or Space chats. You can also put them in Articles and Posts too, if your Host has empowered you to make those.

**Add a GIF:**

Click the GIF button at the bottom-left of the module. Search for the GIF you'd like to send. Send it.

All GIFs on our platform have a G/PG rating.

**Add an emoji or react with one:**

Select the "Insert Emoji" icon and choose your favourite 🤣😀🙌.

You can also react with an emoji in Space chats, private messages, posts and comments.

Selecting the same emoji again will remove your reaction.
