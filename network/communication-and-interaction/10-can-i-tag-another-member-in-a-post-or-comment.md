<summary>Can I Tag Another Member in a Post or Comment?</summary>

To tag or @mention another member in a post or comment, type the "@" symbol and then start typing the person's name.

Once you've tagged a member in a published post or comment, they'll be notified in the app and on the web (and via email if they have email notifications enabled). Their name will also link directly to their profile in your network.
