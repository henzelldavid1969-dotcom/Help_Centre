# Accessing your program

Your Phenomenal Program is running securely online 24/7 and is accessible on any internet connected device, like your laptop, tablet or phone.

Regardless, you'll need to login using your email and password at the following address:

Once you have logged on you will be taken to your program home page, which is the starting point for your sobriety journey.

### The Phenomenal Sobriety Engine

Once on your home page your program is delivered to you in sequence, and you will be guided through the steps in order.

Every page will look the same (aside from the session content) and contains some pretty important buttons and features that help us to help you.

Let's have a look shall we?

* On the \*\*left hand side \*\*you will find a collapsible navigation. Go on, click it - its shows you the entire program and makes it easier for you to navigate. ​
* Next to **the logo at the top**, you'll see a few links, from here you can always return "home", see "all lessons" or access the community. These are the most commonly accessed links, that's why Solly put them at the top. ​
* **Over on the top right**, there are a few tempting icons. You'll absolutely want to press these and see what happens! The chat icon opens your messages - you will receive notifications by the bell icon and you can search the entire program using the search icon.

Solly has been hard at work with this - he has catalogued every single word in the program, so if you get lost or want to find "that bit about triggers" - just type it in and he'll find it for you.



**Coming Soon:**&#x20;

You may start to see a new help icon up here. This is a new helper that's working with Solly. He or she will have specific knowledge on the course and will be able to help you even more. Watch this space.
